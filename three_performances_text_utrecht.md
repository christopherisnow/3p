Even if the here and now is nourished from the past and from future expectations, liveness is the primal paradigm of every musical improvisation, characterised by archetypal elements such as temporal continuity, realtime interaction, presence, immediacy, intimacy, indeterminacy, eventness, existence in the moment, and so forth. Bearing in mind that there is no improvisation without the live, Christopher and I came together to create a unique musical performance. 

This was our first musical encounter, an ad hoc session with no prior agreements about the musical instruments to be played, structural developments, etc. The temporal and spatial conditions, as well as our personal histories and dispositions, were the basis of performance. We happened to use a guitar, a trombone, a piano, a synthesiser, a home stereo with audio cassettes and CDs, and assorted books and objects found at the site of the performance. Occasionally, we moved around and out of the room, allowing bodily movements and positions to become part of the performance.

We audiorecorded our actions to document the event. That recording, which is presently playing on the loudspeakers, served as a memory and point of departure for a written score, which we have just handed out, interwoven with verbal commentary on the score, which we are reading now. Through this documentation, we wished our improvisation to live a transformed performative existence, and provide the means for tracing how it does so. 

In this presentation we would like to explore with you three different ways of understanding how improvisation, notation, and performativity interrelate through this process.

## 1 The Original Performance is Past, this is its ‘Mediatized’ Representation (CW)

Following media theorist Philip Auslander’s claim that ‘ “[m]ediatized performance” is performance that is circulated on television, as audio or video recordings, and in other forms based in technologies of reproduction’, we also consider texts, books or scores to be technologies of reproduction. In this sense, the transcription of the original performance beginning on the first page of our handout could serve as a ‘mediatized performance’ of the primary event, much as would a video or audiotape, like the one playing right now.

Clearly the score cannot be considered a comprehensive or transparent representation of the initial situation, as equally any video or audiotape cannot. Still, the possibility is given that it carries some of the (live) flavour of the initial situation by retaining and sharing with the reader some provisions for recreating its spirit and specificity. Here we recall musicologist Paul Sanden’s statement that ‘[l]iveness represents a perceived *trace* of that which *could* be live ’. 

For example, the score handout assumes the position of a listener who is there, in the performance, attempting to make sense of a music in its emergence as his or her focus bounces among disparate sounds, gestures, and temporalities. Different events are represented with different kinds and degrees of detail — some include specific pitches and/ or articulations, where others are simply assigned a general verbal description (‘rustling’) or association (‘Tristan’) or a physical location in the room (‘hallway’). Words and phrases in the handout such as ‘blowing air’ or ‘growl’ might trigger a sense of physical immediacy. Or the informal memo-like quality of the handwriting might draw you into a more intimate connection with the "live" moment of inscription.

> Shut the door. Resume hot slop. Knock. 
> Open the door. Return. 
> Join pianist:

While temporal and/or spatial co-presence is traditionally the minimum requirement for the definition of liveness, none is given in a direct sense here. However, if we reflect on Auslander’s claim that ‘liveness can no longer be defined in terms of either the presence of living human beings before each other or physical or temporal relationships’, why couldn’t liveness be experienced in notation, just as in other ‘mediatized’ representations? 

Indeed it is difficult to trace the existence and/or effects of liveness at this moment. But we would hazard that your current reading process exhibits many of the same "live" qualities as our "original" recorded performance, without you having been there with us in Mathias' living room. This would substantiate Auslander’s suggestion ‘that thinking about the relationship between live and mediatized forms in terms of ontological oppositions is not especially productive, because there are few grounds on which to make significant ontological distinctions’. 

## 2 This is the Performance, you are the Audience (MM)

> TACET

Having characterised the score (and the present spoken text) as the ‘mediatized’ representation of the original performance, we should also articulate our documentation's distance from the initial event itself. The inherent limitations of the recorded reference and the human ear listening back can only capture a narrow slice of the original event. And just as ‘script is not simply the graphic fixation of spoken language’, as philosopher Sybille Krämer says, a score is not the mere picture of the sounding music. Any score — even a transcription — is an artefact used to *make* music, and thus by necessity omits certain details about its sounding result. For these reasons we can assume that a transcription of sounding music is always reductive. 

At the same time, transcriptive notation produces *new* qualities not inherent in original performances. As musicologist Hartmut Möller states:

> "[s]ystems of written notation relegate a serial, temporally shifted stream of data to a visual field and thereby untether parts of the communication from the context of their origination. Notations accentuate, shorten, and abstract given the abundance of the real sounding event and start a life of their own as documents that allow or even provoke diverse versions."

The layout of the score, for example, in lines read left to right bound by page size, implies phrases or temporal units beyond those of the original performance. Likewise, indices of the tools of inscription — ink pens and an idiosyncratic typewriter — create internal visual connections and disjunctions with no sounding correlate.

A productive tension emerges from this triangulation of a ‘factual’ past live event, what is lost in its ‘mediatized’ representation, and what is added by the particularities of the medium. You may imagine who ‘Tristan’ is, how the ‘HALLWAY’ looks, why its letters are capitalised, or what happens on the next page, even before you do anything with the score out loud. Wayfaring among this push and pull requires an active perception -- what improvisation scholar Ingrid Monson calls "perceptual agency" -- not unlike listening to a concert of improvised music. The score can thus be regarded as a performance even without its factual recreation in an event.

And the "stage" on which our notation performs is of course not limited to an autonomous score. Imagine you were reading the text we are now reading out loud. [SHOW BOOK] Then it might be said that this entire volume was a stage and that you were following one act of the play upon it through the process of reading. You would be attending our second performance as authors of this text and score, in the form of a ‘performance-reading’— conceived as the cousin of a performance-lecture — in real time with your own modes of reception.

## 3 You are the Performer, the Performance is About to Take Place (CW)

Imagine again you were reading our notation and analysis instead of listening to the text and looking at the score. Then we would argue that you are not only the audience attending our performance — you are also the performer of those pages engaged in the ‘act of reading,’ as literary theorist Wolfgang Iser (1976) has famously put it. This would happen as you move along our thoughts and previous artistic acts, make temporal sense of them, shift your attention from the verbal text to the score, or wander back and forth among the pages of the physical book.

> A few muddy long notes, gradually windier. 
> [Whole rest—Fermata]   
> Remove slide, twirl in circles like a baton. 
> Continue, announce: 
> “I shall twirl until you are finished.” 
> [Pf fragment] 

While the symbols and words of a notation may be nominally static, you actively choose when and how to navigate among them. This is a special case of what Iser has termed the reader’s ‘wandering viewpoint’, or ‘the mode, by which the reader is present within the text’. Iser states

> "there is a potential time-sequence which the reader must inevitably realize, as it is impossible to absorb even a short text in a single moment. Thus the reading process always involves viewing the text through a perspective that is continually on the move, linking up the different phases, and so constructing what we have called the virtual dimension. This dimension, of course, varies all the time we are reading."

Although Iser prioritises the role of narrative memory and expectation in the reading process, the same principle of non-linear grouping applies to the counterpoint of the different elements in our 'performance-reading-lecture-performance'. The numerical timeline in the score is only one layer of temporal understanding; the way you situate this unfolding across the four pages — or while listening to us here, right now — is another. Have you concentrated more on our analytical talk, coming back to the score only occasionally, or vice-versa? Have you studied the score continuously from the beginning to the end? Have you concentrated only on one element or the other? When, if ever, have you shuffled back and forth in search of a context for the unexplained instructions projected here on the screen?

However you have chosen to deal with our words, the projections and the handout, you are improvising with those elements, and such parametrical interplay, according to Iser, is what makes meaning possible. Meaning is not necessarily there, but it is co-created by an active reader, or recipient, working with the multiple affordances of the text. 

## ◄◄ Rewind / ►► Fast Forward (MM)

Iser compared texts to musical scores, stressing that the reader’s individual skills are responsible for the instrumentation of the work. Meaning thus ‘appears in individual form’ interwoven with the experiences, attitudes, knowledge, expectations, feelings and will that you contribute to these performances. In this sense we underline Auslander’s thesis that the ‘emerging definition of liveness may be built primarily around the audience’s affective experience’. At the same time, we also wish to expand this thesis by highlighting how this theoretical audience, in the act of reception, takes over the role of a performer. The reader or recipient performs and actively co-constructs meaning and experience, and the seemingly separate entities of performers and recipients thus overlap and permeate each other. This would seem to offer a useful basis on which to consider how musical performance, improvisation, and notation can be entangled rather than opposed.
