# Plan

- distribute printed copies of 4 score pages in book

- 3 min. introduction to us and why we came together to work on the question of liveness in music notation

- start original audio recording (16:40)

- read adapted text, stopping at boxed verbal notations which are projected on the screen

- at TACET, mute audio recording (ca. 30")

## Text changes

- change Intro and 1 for formal issues only (name cited authors, omit page number references, etc.)

- shorten 2 and 3 by omitting references to book format, etc.

- shorten Conclusion
